This repository contains all of the printed parts for the Wuxn WXR 3D Printer Ecosystem. The Wuxn WXR parts may be printed with PETG or ASA filament. However, we highly recommend printing the parts for the extruder and hotbed subassembly with ASA filament, as these parts will experience higher temperatures. 

Please select the following items when printing the Wuxn WXR parts using WuxnSlicer 2.0.0:
+ Machine = Wuxn WXR
+ Material = Wuxn Classic PETG or ASA
+ Profile = Strong (0.16mm)

Some of the Wuxn WXR printed parts require support material. The parts that require support material enabled are as follows:
+ Front Fan Bracket
+ SKR Case

All of the other Wuxn WXR printed parts do not require support material if oriented correctly.
